# QuizApp

#### QuizApp is a single-page application, built with:

- ASP.NET Core and C# for cross-platform server-side code
- Angular and TypeScript for client-side code
- Bootstrap for layout and styling
- xUnit for unit testing

##### To run from Visual Studio - just open the generated .csproj file (or open the whole solution from .sln file to see the unit tests project too), and run the app as normal from there, using Kestrel. To run from  .NET Core CLI -  run `dotnet build`  to verify the app builds correctly. Run `dotnet run`  to start the app. 

The build process restores npm dependencies on the first run, which can take several minutes. Subsequent builds are much faster.
